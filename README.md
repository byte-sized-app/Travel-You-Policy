### Privacy Policy for TravelYou

**Effective Date:** `01/20/2026`

Thank you for using TravelYou ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.

Please read this policy carefully.

### 1. The Core Principle: You Are in Control

Our app is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. The core functionality of creating a trip from your photos is designed to work completely offline. Your personal data does not leave your device unless you explicitly decide to share it.

### 2. What Information We Collect and Why

To provide the App's services, we need to access certain data.

*   **Photos and EXIF Data:** The App's main feature is to create a visual map of your trips. To do this, we need access to your photo library. From the photos you select, we read the **Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) data**. This includes:
    *   **GPS Coordinates (Location):** To plot your photos accurately on the map.
    *   **Timestamps (Date/Time):** To arrange your photos in chronological order.

    This information is essential for the App to function as intended. We do not access any photos you do not explicitly select for a trip.

*   **Account Information (Future Feature):** When you choose to create an account to use our sharing features, we will collect basic profile information from the authentication provider you select (e.g., Google or Apple), such as your name and email address.

### 3. How Your Information is Stored and Used

We have two distinct modes of operation, and your data is handled differently in each.

#### **A. When You Use The App Offline (Current Phase)**

This is the default mode of the App.

*   All photos you select and their corresponding EXIF data (coordinates and timestamps) are processed and stored **exclusively on your device**.
*   This information is **never** uploaded to our servers or any third-party service.
*   The trip you create is private and only accessible to you from your phone.

#### **B. When You Choose to Upload and Share (Future Phase)**

You have the option to upload a created trip to our servers to get a shareable link. This action is entirely voluntary.

*   **Explicit Consent:** We will only upload your trip data when you explicitly perform the "Upload and Share" action within the App.
*   **What is Uploaded:** The photos you selected for that specific trip and their associated location and timestamp data will be transmitted and stored securely on our backend servers (hosted on [e.g., Google Cloud, AWS]) and our file storage provider, Cloudflare R2.
*   **Purpose:** This data is stored for the sole purpose of allowing you to share your trip with others via a unique link.

### 4. Data Retention and Deletion

We believe you should have full control over your data's lifecycle.

*   **Automatic Deletion:** By default, any trip data (photos and coordinates) you upload to our servers will be **automatically and permanently deleted one (1) year** after the date of upload. We do this to minimize the amount of personal data we store.

*   **User-Controlled Deletion:** You have full control over your shared content. You can delete any of your uploaded trips **directly from within the App at any time**. This action is often presented as "Stop Sharing" or "Delete Trip." Upon taking this action, the trip and all its associated photos and data will be permanently deleted from our servers. This deletion process is initiated immediately. Deletion propagation may take a few days depending on our server provider.

### 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

### 6. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

### 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App or on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
